# TDD Mocha Factorial
This is my second TDD script focussed on testing a factorial method

## Initial Idea
Use the Mocha test framework to create a fast, complete, reliable, isolated, maintainable, and expressive test suite to ensure that the factorial method is functioning correctly. In doing so this will create a form of documentation for other developers.

### Comments & Thought Process
TDD is pretty fun and I wish I'd come across it sooner. It's a great way to really interrogate code and I think it's something that students learning JavaScript should come across almost immediately straight after learning about data types. If I did I feel that I would have progressed much faster because I'd have been able to really understand the ins and outs of my code earlier on, rather than confronting that later on.

I tend to have a habit of brute forcing code - and TDD is a good platform that encourages you to use brute force at first but with the idea of then refactoring it later to be more efficient (efficient != elegant haha). I really like it!
